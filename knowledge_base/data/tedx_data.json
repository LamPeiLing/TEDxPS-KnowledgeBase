Communication designer Jeffrey Lim’s journey in formulating his creative direction originates from the spokes of wheels from bicycles. They are forms in which his designs, photographies and art projects take inspiration from; from techniques involved in making new concept bicycles, to recycling used parts in bicycles into new products; from the art of photography to the physical transformation of cameras from bygone eras to the present, Jeffrey is at the forefront of recycling materials from objects of passion. An avid commercial photographer, his photos have provided basis for making his communication design work more documentary, laced with stories within. From 2004 to 2012, travelling from Southeast asia to Europe, he has photographed almost everything culturally significant, making his works a historical visual documentation of items of historical value. Another, Jeffrey Lim’s single art project involving encouraging social communities to cycle -- attempting to rediscover the most basic of human transportation -- is testament of his determination in bringing the simple and yet multifaceted activity back in the human consciousness, as a form of transporation, a form of leisure, a form of sporting activity.

    "bio": "In 1997, Bernard Goh founded Hands Percussion (HANDS). Although a graduate of the Malaysian Institute of Arts (MIA); he developeddeep interest and passion in percussive music. 6 years as a multi-award winning instructor trained him well, not to mention cultivated his love for percussion. Under the tutelage of Mr Tan Fui Choong – the founder of 24 Festive Drumming (a unique drumming technique developed in Malaysia) – in shigu drumming, Bernard founded the Malaysian drumming company. For 17 years, he has successfully led the group to become one of the leading percussive groups in the world. Intercultural in practice, Bernard Goh has also collaborated with many music artists, including The Actors Studio, River Grass Dance Theatre, Nyoba Kan, Judimar Hernandez and many others. Together with his company HANDS, since 2005, he has performed at various international art festivals and events in The Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, France, Australia, Hawaii, Qatar, Turkmenistan, Dubai, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, to name a few. In 2009, HANDS was commissioned by the French Government to tour and perform in several cities in France. Notably Bernard won his first Cammy in the 2nd BOH Cameronian Art Awards for Rashomon (2003) by The Actors Studio. It was for Best Music & Sound Design for the Theatre category, together with Deborah Tee. In 2011 and 2012, he won the “Best Musical Direction” for his productions “Dreams in November” and “Knocking” at the 8th and 9th BOH Cameronian Arts Awards respectively.",
    "introduction": "From [designer] to [drum musician], Bernard Goh has continuously walked on the art road. Because of his teacher's words, he has the value that \"creation should not be framed by the inherent\", and he believes that the [Drum Ensemble] must have its own voice, make local sounds, and sound out the rhythm of representative elements. Therefore, we are looking forward to more of his future works that go beyond drumming, such as body percussion, pants, and so on. That's how Bernard Goh is still a real designer.",

He named it Terra Organic Farm. Two years later, he took courses in New Zealand and Australia in a farming technique called Bio Dynamic Farming. After two to three years in learning the ropes and familiarising with the new farming technique, he implemented the said farming technique fully across his farms, in 2010. From then on, he responsibly uses appropriate machines to level the land. Nestled in the quiet Cameron Highlands, Terra Organic Farm is a place for urbanites to get close to nature. For the luxurious fresh air and scenic view offered, travellers are encouraged to take their own time, to slow down their pace, to breathe in the fresh air and enjoy the breath-taking view of the forest and hills. He also constructs his own tree-houses for visiting guests.",

Through his sharing of the depths of the natural world, we are alerted to the extent to which hardening of the land can affect the world, and in this age of technological advancement, we seem to be far removed from science, violating the wisdom of the science of cultivation. Through Shennong's pictures, we can understand the response of \"Bio-Dynamic Agriculture\" to balance the survival mode of the earth. It turns out that planting does not need fertilizers, but only [vitality], so that the technology of [natural farming] can replace [chemical fertilizer agriculture], and we can see that there is a bright road in the future.

Through Shennong's pictures, we can understand the response of \"Bio-Dynamic Agriculture\" to balance the survival mode of the earth. It turns out that planting does not need fertilizers, but only [vitality], so that the technology of [natural farming] can replace [chemical fertilizer agriculture], and we can see that there is a bright road in the future. Listening to you is better than reading a hundred years of books."

        "introduction": "黃田環，被誉为神农，在金马伦建造土屋，投入于天然种植，专研有机培育，也为城市人提供住在农场的服务，去体会原始森林的感悟。透过他对自然界博大精深的分享，我们警觉土地硬化能够影响世界的幅度甚广，在这科技进步的时代，我们仿佛却远离了科学，违反了种植的科学智慧。透过神农的图片显示，我们可以了解到 『活力農耕（Bio-Dynamic Agriculture）』的应对方案，达到平衡地球的生存模式，原来，种植不需要肥料，只需要［活力］，这样[自然农耕］的技术，可以取代［化肥农业］，我们看见未来有道光明的路。听君一席话，胜读百年书。"

    "bio": "Being Malaysia’s one and only luthier -- the violin maker -- and the only Malaysian who has been trained in this skill, Ong Ket Wei is a proud alumnus of the acclaimed the international school of violin making named Stradivarius School in Cremona, Italy. He has done his teacher Maestro Massimo Negroni proud by bringing the technique of violin making rooted in the traditional classical cremonese style, coupled with the unique reddish amber with brown and antique colored varnishing to Malaysia. He aspires to promote the art of Italian violin making in Malaysia. Ket Wei’s passion in violin making comes from his music training in classical and jazz guitar, under the guidance of Juan Pablop De Zubiria Rueda. Coupled with double bass, his passion was brought to another level, under the mentorship of Mr.Foo Yin Hong and Mr.Joesph Pruesser, with whom the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) has nurtured. Currently, Ong Ket Wei professionally plays the double bass in a variety of genres, from contemporary music to jazz, with the Malaysian Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (MPYO), National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) and the Orchestra Radio Televisyen Malaysia (ORTM). He also frequently plays with the Penang Symphony Orchestra (PSO).",
    "introduction": "Ong Ket Wei, an Italian-trained violinist and the only violin maker in Malaysia, shares with us today the relationship between wood and music. He tells us in a few minutes about the process of making a violin with simple pictures, and Kiwei's love and professionalism for violin making goes beyond the [interest] of ordinary people. This luthier, who listens with his heart and mixes with his hands, can be called the doctor of the violin, who tunes the soul of the player with his life, and this kind of delicate spirit towards life is called an expert.",

How long has it been since you last learned diligently? The repetitive processes keep going on.\r\n\r\nGoing back to ground zero with our hearts composed, by releasing all knowledge gained and letting go, we seek new knowledge, begin drawing the line from a dot, which then diversifies, amplifies, and spreads into various ideas and concepts. Progress would not happen if there's no discernment after learning. Slack and incompetence would take place if there's no practice after discernment. Just like sailing against strong currents, the continuous quest for learning to acquire new knowledge, and the ability to adapt and be flexible during uncertainties lead to viable and positive outcomes resulting from changes. ‘Borderless’ in learning, let's get inspired by the beauty of learning.",

Together with four other friends, the 27-year-old cycled around Peninsula Malaysia - across eleven states and 2,663km - a journey which took them 96 days. Choong felt that like many fellow Malaysians, he has succumbed to the numerous stereotypical views that we harbour towards our country, such as the rising crime rates, influx of foreign labours, and the unfavourable weather. He decided to prove himself wrong by taking on this adventure to re-experience his own country. Choong brought along coffee and tea to facilitate interaction with different people he met along the way, and through their stories, reflected on what it means to be Malaysian.",
        "introduction": "“The moment you leave your home, the learning journey begins”Before the cycling tour, Choong Zi En has a stereotyped view about Malaysia. However, this changed after his cycling tour with his friend around peninsular Malaysia. Every kilometer of his cycling drew him closer to revisit and relearn about Malaysia again."

Malaysian-born Huang started learning drumming at six and martial arts at ten, before taking a number of spiritual journeys to India and Tibet. He joined the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and has gone on tour in Europe, the US and Africa. In 1993, Huang co-founded U Theatre with Liu Rou-Yu, a Taiwanese theatrical performer, and introduced novel facets of drumming by embodying the regime of “meditation before drumming”, thus synthesizing the two disciplines into a new form of performance art.",
        "introduction": "What is the secret of performing arts? U-Theatre Taiwan music director Huang Chih-chun believes that a performance artist should master three aspects, namely the rational core, the emotional core, and the movement core, which would allow them an ever-changing and endless expressive ability. In the case of a drumming performance, the three aspects are rhythm (rational), music (emotional), and beat (movement)."

Besides singing and composing, Chong is also involved in music arrangement, teaching, post-production and organizing music festivals.",

As a a promising young primatologist, she would carry out her mission for observation in sweat along her telescope, navigation system and notepad into the forest that most people would choose to stay away from, in order to save the endangered primate langurs. The chivalrous “monkey woman” who was rescued by shy yet adorable white-eyed langurs before, relied on long hours observation to record and study langurs, who are way lesser-known than chimpanzees and orangutans, in order to understand how langurs endure the shattered habitat and the dynamic coexistence between humans and animals.",
        "introduction": "Compared to chimpanzees and orangutans, white-eyed langurs are a much lesser known species of endangered primates, consequently most people do not understand that white-eyed langurs' natural habitat has been jeopardized to fulfill human needs. As the leader of the conservation project, Jo Leen Yap carries out her observation in the forest. Besides that, she also organizes guided outdoor tours to raise public awareness towards langurs, and also to educate the public about the importance of coexistence between humans and animals."

He is Malaysia's only recipient of the Fellowship of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (FCOVD), a national organization dedicated to vision development and vision therapy. As opposed to a typical optometrist, Tien's role as a visual development therapist involves analyzing and evaluating how vision impacts the daily activity of patients, while providing the necessary treatment to improve their quality of life by raising their functional vision.",
    "introduction": "Optical neurodevelopmental therapist Stanley Tien’s mission is to be the voice of our eyes and brain. Beside vision, our eyes are also responsible for 16 other different functions. Each function plays a key role in various situations, which is then processed by the brain to piece together the scene we see everyday. The impact and importance of vision on our lives are far greater than we usually expect. Through different examples, Tien explained the impact of visual and hearing impairment on daily life, allowing us a renewed understanding of the windows to our soul.",

He graduated from the University of Wales, UK, majoring in Optometry, before specializing in vision and neurological behavior development. He is Malaysia's only recipient of the Fellowship of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (FCOVD), a national organization dedicated to vision development and vision therapy. As opposed to a typical optometrist, Tien's role as a visual development therapist involves analyzing and evaluating how vision impacts the daily activity of patients, while providing the necessary treatment to improve their quality of life by raising their functional vision.",
        "introduction": "Optical neurodevelopmental therapist Stanley Tien’s mission is to be the voice of our eyes and brain. Beside vision, our eyes are also responsible for 16 other different functions. Each function plays a key role in various situations, which is then processed by the brain to piece together the scene we see everyday. The impact and importance of vision on our lives are far greater than we usually expect. Through different examples, Tien explained the impact of visual and hearing impairment on daily life, allowing us a renewed understanding of the windows to our soul."

In view of this, Tan Sri Andrew Sheng believes that we should use the three-valued logic thinking to analyze our own strengths and problems.

Malaysia is blessed with abundant natural resources, and our multilingual ability plus cultural diversity also give us a great advantage in foreign markets. However, many young Malaysians today lack trust towards the country, the race, and themselves; i.e., we are short on the “people” aspect of the three factors. Hence, he emphasized that we need to have “faith” and “will” to overcome the crisis. Young Malaysians must allow themselves and their peers to have the trust they deserve, and convert that strong will into action. By being brave to take risks, be entrepreneurial and create value, only can we have the ability to advantageously align the three major factors - timing, geography, and people - in our favour.",

His outstanding performance was recognized by the national team and world-renowned coaches Kitamura and Lu Yao. Less than a year after completing his training, he joined the national Sports Council (MSN) esports coaching team officially. Under his coaching, his team won various local and international championships consecutively, and he represented the national team at the 2022 SEA Games. With his strength, confidence, grapple skills, strategies and tactics, he has broken the stereotypes of esports as a \"pseudo profession\" or \"harmful towards young people.\"",
    "introduction": "Esports is not merely a recreational activity, but a combination of sports and competitive gaming. Esports can be considered as a derivative of chess - it also follows Zermelo’s theorem - but in Esports, the permutation of possibilities far surpasses it. Originally a math and science tutor, Coach Stanley teamed up with his students to participate in an Esports tournament as a way to get along better with them. Facing a stronger opponent from a national level, they managed to withstand the pressure and turned the tables tactically, defeating their opponent to win the game. Since then, Coach Stanley has a renewed appreciation for Esports and acknowledged it as a remarkable mental challenge; not only it tests players’ ability to master strategy and tactics, but also logical thinking within a four-dimensional space. Now, as a national Esports coach, Coach Stanley dedicates himself to the industry and studies Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” diligently to continue improving himself as an outstanding mentor.",

        "name": "Coach Stanley",
        "occupation": "Esports coach of Malaysia National team",
        "bio": "Coach Stanley is the esports coach of Malaysia National team. He was deeply moved by the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) by chance and decided to pursue esports professionally. His outstanding performance was recognized by the national team and world-renowned coaches Kitamura and Lu Yao. Less than a year after completing his training, he joined the national Sports Council (MSN) esports coaching team officially. Under his coaching, his team won various local and international championships consecutively, and he represented the national team at the 2022 SEA Games. With his strength, confidence, grapple skills, strategies and tactics, he has broken the stereotypes of esports as a \"pseudo profession\" or \"harmful towards young people.\"",
        "introduction": "Esports is not merely a recreational activity, but a combination of sports and competitive gaming. Esports can be considered as a derivative of chess - it also follows Zermelo’s theorem - but in Esports, the permutation of possibilities far surpasses it. Originally a math and science tutor, Coach Stanley teamed up with his students to participate in an Esports tournament as a way to get along better with them. Facing a stronger opponent from a national level, they managed to withstand the pressure and turned the tables tactically, defeating their opponent to win the game. Since then, Coach Stanley has a renewed appreciation for Esports and acknowledged it as a remarkable mental challenge; not only it tests players’ ability to master strategy and tactics, but also logical thinking within a four-dimensional space. Now, as a national Esports coach, Coach Stanley dedicates himself to the industry and studies Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” diligently to continue improving himself as an outstanding mentor."

    "introduction": "Chocolate Concierge founder Ong Ning Geng is embarking on a lifelong journey to search for a local flavour that can represent Malaysia globally. He recalled tasting a cocoa fruit at an oil palm plantation when he was a child - its richness still lingered in his memory until today. However, why are most Malaysians so unfamiliar with cocoa fruits these days? To search for the taste in his memory, Ong signed up for a cocoa planting course organized by the Malaysian Cocoa Board. He also got to know the local aboriginal villagers where cocoa is grown and sought to learn about natural cocoa farming methods from them. The fertile soil in Malaysia is very suited for growing cocoa trees, and the original taste of the cocoa berries can be preserved using natural farming. Applying the knowledge he learnt, Ong started to dry cocoa beans at home, fermented them, and managed to recreate the flavour he had in his memory. He later purchased an orchard to produce pure, single-origin chocolate that is proudly Malaysian.",

        "introduction": "Chocolate Concierge founder Ong Ning Geng is embarking on a lifelong journey to search for a local flavour that can represent Malaysia globally. He recalled tasting a cocoa fruit at an oil palm plantation when he was a child - its richness still lingered in his memory until today. However, why are most Malaysians so unfamiliar with cocoa fruits these days? To search for the taste in his memory, Ong signed up for a cocoa planting course organized by the Malaysian Cocoa Board. He also got to know the local aboriginal villagers where cocoa is grown and sought to learn about natural cocoa farming methods from them. The fertile soil in Malaysia is very suited for growing cocoa trees, and the original taste of the cocoa berries can be preserved using natural farming. Applying the knowledge he learnt, Ong started to dry cocoa beans at home, fermented them, and managed to recreate the flavour he had in his memory. He later purchased an orchard to produce pure, single-origin chocolate that is proudly Malaysian."

        "introduction": "本着对本土风味的热爱与执着，Chocolate Concierge 创办人王宁耿一路探索，不停寻找能代表马来西亚的世界级风味。他想起小时候在油棕园初尝的可可果，丰富的口感使他至今仍难以忘怀。然而，为何如今马来西亚人对可可果如此陌生？为了寻找记忆中的风味，王宁耿报名参加大马可可局举办的可可种植课程，认识种植可可树的原住民，并从他们身上习得自然农法。马来西亚的土壤非常适用于种植可可树，使用自然农法能够保存可可果的原滋原味。习得这种种植方式后，王宁耿在家中将可可豆晒干后进行发酵，成功寻获记忆中尝过的那一颗风味万种的巧克力。后来，他也购入一片园地，从可可树到巧克力的单元生产线，王宁耿成功制作纯粹的、属于马来西亚风味的巧克力。"

In each of their musical endeavors, HaBa experiments and blends various digital materials with organic sound source, hoping to achieve a \"self-balance\" between music and the universe, thus bestowing a multi-dimensional meaning to sound.

    "introduction": "Apparently, pottery creations can not only be seen, but also be listened to! Handpan and bass duet, HaBa, used the handmade ceramic musical instruments created by sculptor James Seet to produce sounds with earthy and soulful harmony. It is worth mentioning that most ceramic instruments do not have the familiar “do re mi” scale, so it is up to the musicians to improvise using their own senses and feeling. Under HaBa’s creative interpretation, there are ethereal drums with changing rhythms, clear gurgling streams, and rustling sound of leaves in the wind. These sounds - natural, unpretentious, and crisp - provide a therapeutic listening experience.",

        "bio": "Handpan and bass duet, HaBa, was formed in 2018 by musicians Kent Lee and Thong Yoong How with the purpose of exploring the possibilities of sound and ideas. In each of their musical endeavors, HaBa experiments and blends various digital materials with organic sound source, hoping to achieve a \"self-balance\" between music and the universe, thus bestowing a multi-dimensional meaning to sound. HaBa has represented Malaysia in Dance in Asia 2019 (Indonesia) and Dance in Asia 2020 (online performance); they also toured multiple universities in China with percussion band.",
        "introduction": "Apparently, pottery creations can not only be seen, but also be listened to! Handpan and bass duet, HaBa, used the handmade ceramic musical instruments created by sculptor James Seet to produce sounds with earthy and soulful harmony. It is worth mentioning that most ceramic instruments do not have the familiar “do re mi” scale, so it is up to the musicians to improvise using their own senses and feeling. Under HaBa’s creative interpretation, there are ethereal drums with changing rhythms, clear gurgling streams, and rustling sound of leaves in the wind. These sounds - natural, unpretentious, and crisp - provide a therapeutic listening experience."

        "introduction": "陶艺品原来不只能看，还能“听”！手碟与贝斯双人组 (HaBa) 使用由薛文杰手工制作的陶乐器，演奏和敲击出大地与灵魂的唱和。值得一提的是，大部分的陶作乐器都没有人们所熟知的“do re mi”标准音阶，全凭演奏者跟着音乐和自我感官去自由发挥。而在 HaBa 的创意诠释下，有的是节奏多变的空灵鼓声、清澈的潺潺流水声、树叶在风中摇摆发出的沙沙声……这些宛如大自然的声音，朴实无华，清脆无染，疗愈人心。"

        "bio": "黄晓斌，本地资深建筑师，也是吉隆坡第一所森林学校的创始人。当人生开始步入育儿阶段，与一般父母相仿，他为孩子的教育感到忧虑。他开始思考，什么样的教育体系对孩子才是最友善、最合适的？后来他在对人智学颇有研究的妻子身上获得启发，加上从事建筑行业多年积累的经验，他领略到孩子与自然生态系统“对话”的重要性。因此，他参考并借鉴国外流行多年的教育体系——“华德福教育”，在本地吉隆坡开办第一所以全人教育为核心的森林学校，通过想象、创造与体验的方式，激发孩童的 (学习) 意愿 (willing)、情感 (feeling) 以及思维 (thinking)，提供孩子回归大自然、并从大自然身上学习的机会。",
        "introduction": "一般的城市教育体系往往培育孩子看重功利而忽视人性，使孩子缺乏与大自然接触和沟通的机会。面对后疫情时代的重启，我们要重新思考，有什么更好的教育方式可以替代旧有的教育系统？吉隆坡华德福教育发起人黄晓斌从小女儿热衷学习英文草书上领悟到，要让孩子热爱学习，首先要让孩子发现“美”，而华德福所提倡的全人教育正是培养孩子美与人性的教育。在建筑行业驰骋多年的他也了解到，森林是和谐与包容的，孩子可以从中汲取各种有益身心的学习素材。如果要实现全人教育与大自然的结合，最好的学习环境就是森林。因此，黄晓斌在吉隆坡创办第一所森林学校，办校的理念如他所说：“让孩子因美丽而赞叹，因赞叹而感动，因感动而由衷地投入学习和奉献。”"

He was the Managing Director at Shell Chemicals, where he worked for 32 years before electing to retire in 1999 at the tender age of 53. Since then, he has gradually checked off items on his bucket list, including driving across 120 countries on 6 continents; sailing to Antarctica 7 times, and becoming the oldest person to obtain a paramotor flying qualification at 68. Yusuf proved that age is not a hindrance to achieving goals. His adventurous spirit and desire to continue learning make him an exemplar to the younger generation.",
        "introduction": "How would you plan to spend your life? Yusuf Hashim spent the first half of his life excelling at his field, in the upper echelons of the petroleum industry. He chose to retire at 53 and spend his later years exploring the natural world through photography, travelling across six continents and over 120 nations, including 6 visits to Antarctica. His message for us is that time and life are priceless– it is vital for us to explore all the potential that life has to offer."

Trained as an architect in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), he is also an independent researcher focusing on Nusantara art and cultural heritage.

Proposed to have been established in the 1st century A.D., Langkasuka is a matriarchal Kingdom with a unique culture. The warriors of Langkasuka were formidable and famed for their courage and fearlessness. Their sumptuous meal before a war was more than just a feast; in fact, they encoded military strategy within the arrangement of their food placement on the table.",

    "introduction": "“Besides reflecting Malaysia’s unique visual culture, shop signs are also a record of the culture, history, economy, politics, and lifestyle at the time; as if they are living textbooks on the streets.”Typeface designer Tan Sueh Li has been conducting her research on typography in the context of cultural integration over the years. She described how “multilingualism” and “multi-literacy” is a distinct cultural phenomenon in Malaysia’s shop signs. Over time the traces left by these diverse fonts and craftsmanship have become symbols and epitomes of a place’s memories, while also representing the cultural identities of the locals. Her observations have taught her to respect the expertise and pair of hands behind the creation of every sign. It gave her the courage to reconnect with the community and rediscover the places where she grew up with a renewed perspective.",

        "bio": "Tan Sueh Li is the founder and typeface designer of Huruf. Driven by her passion for exploring multi-script typography and font development, Sueh Li founded Huruf with a desire to discover a unique Malaysian identity in typography and type design. Grab Community, a type family she co-designed for the superapp Grab, received a Certificate of Typographic Excellence in the 2021 Typeface Design Competition from the Type Directors Club in New York. Sueh Li hopes to take us on a journey of discovering local aesthetics, cultural significance, and stories by looking at signboards on the streets and sharing with us the inspiring lessons she learnt from these observations.",
        "introduction": "“Besides reflecting Malaysia’s unique visual culture, shop signs are also a record of the culture, history, economy, politics, and lifestyle at the time; as if they are living textbooks on the streets.”Typeface designer Tan Sueh Li has been conducting her research on typography in the context of cultural integration over the years. She described how “multilingualism” and “multi-literacy” is a distinct cultural phenomenon in Malaysia’s shop signs. Over time the traces left by these diverse fonts and craftsmanship have become symbols and epitomes of a place’s memories, while also representing the cultural identities of the locals. Her observations have taught her to respect the expertise and pair of hands behind the creation of every sign. It gave her the courage to reconnect with the community and rediscover the places where she grew up with a renewed perspective."
